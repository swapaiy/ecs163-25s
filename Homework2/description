This dashboard analyzes the influence of music listening habits on mental health using the Music and Mental Health Survey dataset. It features three coordinated views, each created using unique visualization methods in D3.js.
  
 
I first did the Bar Chart which hows the spread of participants favorite music genres, giving an overview of general preference across multiple genres in the dataset. Next was the plot which shows the relationship of self-reported levels of anxiety and depression. The view allows you to see organized patterns and clusters across the two main indicators of mental health. Next was the histogram which shows how many hours of music participants typically listen to during their day (1-24). You can also see how music factors into participants' daily routines. All views implemented D3.js, and each piece of functionality is commented in the provided javascript file (main.js). There are no other external packages (other than D3) used in the code, and all assignment requirements were met. I had tried implementing sankey but after many times it did not work which is why I made the parallel coordinates plot. In the process of switching plot types I had used Chat GpT to help fix issues that came during the transfer. Each visualization includes proper axes, titles, and labels and each view had a consistent color. I followed the template file for the base code.
